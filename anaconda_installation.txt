khartes is written in Python; it requires a number of 
external modules.  Below are the Anaconda commands 
I used in Windows to import the needed modules.  
Probably the pip commands and module names are 
similar, but I haven't tested them.  

One possibly unfamiliar package is pynrrd, 
which implements (in pure python) the NRRD format 
(Nearly Raw Raster Data).  This format consists 
of an ascii header followed by binary raster data;
khartes uses this format for storing data volumes.

Another unusual package is rectpack, which is
used for packing 2D rectangles in a minimum-size box.
It is called when exporting textures in the export-mesh
function.

User hari_seldon has informed me that the pip equivalent 
of opencv is opencv-python-headless (Thanks hari!).

The list below shows how to install modules from the
default conda repository.  

conda create -n khartes
conda activate khartes
conda install opencv
conda install pyqt
conda install tifffile
conda install zarr
conda install scipy
conda install pyopengl
conda install requests
conda install aiohttp
conda install fsspec
conda install -c conda-forge pynrrd
conda install -c conda-forge rectpack

If you want to live on the bleeding edge, you can
install the conda-forge versions of all these packages.

Alternatively, you can create a new environment and install all dependencies:

conda env create -f environment.yml

Once finished, you can activate the environment and run Khartes:

conda activate khartes
python khartes.py

And to exit the environment run:

conda deactivate
